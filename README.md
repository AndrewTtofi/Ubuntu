# Ubuntu
My new OS :)


The past years I was involved with Linux Terminals alot so I decided to switch from a lifetime user of Windows to the Linux Family, specifically Ubuntu.
During my transition there are a lot of challenges that I faced.
Primarily the interface and as I proceed on exploring the Linux OS on my personal computer, many others.
This repo will include many of the changes that I made to be able to perfom in a more efficient manner.
For anyone interested take a look in this repo that will ease up the transition from Windows to Linux.
